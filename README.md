# Page action buttons for Firefox

Firefox has support for nice [page action buttons](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Page_actions), which are shown in the URL bar only on certain pages defined in addon's `manifest.json` file. 

In this repo I gathered some page actions which I came up with and created for personal use. These addons are super small, so I found it more handy to list them under single GitHub repository.

- [Toggle Github.dev](./toggle-github-dev/)
- [Open in Freedium](./open-in-freedium/)
