### Page action buttons for Firefox

Firefox has support for nice [page action buttons](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Page_actions), which are shown in the URL bar only on certain pages you define. 

In this repo I gathered some page actions which I came up with and created for personal use. Since addons for these are super small, I found it more handy to list them under single GitHub repository.

### List
- [Toggle Github.dev](./page-action-for-github-dev/)
- [Open in Freedium](./page-action-for-freedium/)
